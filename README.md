## About this version of blender

This version is unofficial but was compiled using the code found on the following websites: 

https://github.com/blender/blender/releases/tag/v2.76b

and

https://github.com/blender/blender-addons/releases/tag/v2.79.

I'm a regular user and not part of the official Blender development team. I enjoy compiling code. I tried compiling Blender for ARMv7, it worked, and I'm sharing it here.
